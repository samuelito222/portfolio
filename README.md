# I don't know what I'm doing

Ok. Well, really who does? So I'm just creating a record here of my learning process. Currently as far as my software production skills go. (A large frwon emerges on my face and my brow furrows) My code ain't that good. I'm at the get it to work currently. As far as code readability, reusability and adaptability; I'm not that much of a software developer. But I enjoy what I'm doing. The internet is way cool like a #moscow mule.

So if you are hiring and our philosophies are not incompatible. Think of me in a few months. Gracias.
