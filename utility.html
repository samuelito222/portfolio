  <h5 class="card-title">Schizophrenia</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Huh. What is it? Absolutely! Symptoms: lack of insight, can't sit still, disorganized behavior, lack of emotions. But what is going on in the brain. I mean. We're still people. The outer cortex is turned off. The frontal lobes. Off. The emotional center in me is on overload with residual toxicity. It's like I'm so sad I'm beyond crying. Just think positive works though, but my tendency is towards negativity in everything. Change happens in time though. Like lifting a feather. A thousand puffs of breath are more effective than a finger.</p>
