        <strong>I don't know muchs about my interior stuff</strong>  This is the meaning of anosognosia. Basically the word means a lack of insight. Kinda seems huffy for a psychiatrist to invent a term that means he knows more about you than you do, but it's an actual thing. I didn't know much about what I've experienced before I really thought about my life.<code> Everybody knows what they've been through</code>, This took a lot of time. I would sit stuck asking myself how does one think about oneself. A therapist of mine asked me to list twenty adjectives that described myself. This was quite tough. But over time (years for me) I've gained a poco bit of insight.      </div>

        <strong>I can't sit still.</strong> For me, part of this is my fight or flight response is always going off. The answer for me is to find something I like to do and can't kinda forget about other stuff. Coding a web page is difficult. I get bothered and need to take breaks, but I also like the results when a web page works. I listen to music. I have my water jug close by and a tidbit of snacks. <code>Sitting still is relative.</code> I haven't solved this one yet, but I hope what I'm sharing helps.      </div>

        <strong>How to feel if you can't feel.</strong> First off we must listen to Phil Collins singing I can feel it in the air tonight. Then begin with simple emotions. I started with shame. I've done some shameful things. No excuses being sick, some things I've done have been shameful. I can feel sad, but it's easier to cry for someone else. Did something happen in high school and someone got hurt (emotionally) becuase of your envolvement? Cry for them!<code>Don't be a robot</code> Then move on to anger. I had to learn about disgust. You can imagine some of my behavior if I had no sense of disgust! Don't write that they don't have to know everything!

<strong>Things take time to accomplish. This requires organization.</strong>
On a pleasant stay in a psychiatric hospital. Our group had a visit and listened to a presentation from some volunteers from NAMI. One mentioned he was planning on three consecutive bachelor degrees. I am in a similar situation as to thinking my interests are too expansive. How do I accomplish them all. For one I got a planner and take copious notes. One would think my planner. The stickers, the post it notes are all a jumble, and they are. But I'm improving on my organization. Another tool is reduction. Find out what you can do without. I thought electronics were the neatest thing. But on second thought I can do without playing with a soltering iron and coding on a raspberry pi.
