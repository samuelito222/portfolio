<p class="positioned">This is some important text about schizophrenia. As someone with schizophrenia, I have come to understand that learning is very difficult. It's tough to change the brain. It's like being in a rut. Just driving the same way over and over again. No fun indeed.</p>
<p>Also as someone with schizophrenia, I've learned that I have super powers. Incredible ability to sleep it off. I can indure and overcome extremely delusional thoughts. So maybe one of the lesser super heros, like a PRN at a psychiatric hospital. They're still pretty super. And... Well this is really just filler text for me to learn so in no way do I think I have super powers, I do respect PRN and all those who work at psychiatric hospitals. It's a tough tough tough job.</p>
