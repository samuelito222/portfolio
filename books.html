  <h5 class="card-title">Feeling Good</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Feeling Good by David Burns was the first self help book someone gave me. I took the depression index test, scored indicated I had depression, got discouraged and set the book down for about nine years. Burns gets into the change your way of thinking and you can change your life. Kinda the I think this so I behave this way so I feel this so I think this: cycle. My thought patterns seemed intractable, but over time you can change your mind/brain.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">Blueprint for Recovery from Schizophrenia</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Milt Greek gave me some home. He explained in a first person manner his experience with schizophrenia. Relatives with strong personalities. (He sugar coated this a bit.) Also he covered the strange anomolous experiences that can convince someone of psychosis. What is real anyways just don't always trust your mind. Because what you experience even how true it seems probably isn't actually what is happenning. This is just not a good way to view the world, a real versus not real perspective. Think how do I feel, ground myself. It is not my job to determine the absolute truth.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">The Road Less Traveld</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Mental Illness is spiritual illness was the insight I took from this consortiom of printed pages. I listend to a sermon of the first Baptist Church Dallas and the preacher kind intimated that soul, spirit, mind are just loosey goosey words that are just jumbled up. When one gets the sniffles they all get sick. I don't mean to criticize because he's not a philosopher and crisp thinking is not what he's paid for. But having one's own definition of the spirit, the soul and the mind are good for someone experience a grave illness like schizophrenia. I like the sermons anyways they give me hope and love is better than criticism. Not that I love him that way. I love him in Saint Paul's definition of love: patience and kindness.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">The Body Keeps the Score</h5>
      <p class="card-text">This is an important book. This is very helpful in knowing what goes on in the brain after trauma. As far as therapies go, the book doesn't offer too much; but I think this is just where the science is. Reading about trauma for me was quite difficult. I had to put the book down for months. This may be difficult for you as well so be careful.</p>
