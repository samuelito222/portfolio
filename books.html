<p style="text-align: justify;">My blurb on bibliotherapy. Why books? There is so much to learn from what someone else has come up with. History is what, about 6000 years? So we have that long of recorded history to glean from the wisdom of those that came before. Plus currently anyone could write a book. You no longer are barred by publishers. You can pay amazon to print your book for you. So everybody is giving away their thoughts.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">Feeling Good</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Feeling Good by David Burns was the first self help book someone gave me. I took the depression index test; and scoring highly, this indicated I had a severe depression. This fact for some reason discouraged me and I set the book down for about nine years. I eventually found the belief that I have to help myself and picking this book back up, found the premise that changing one's thinking can lift one out of depression, as hopeful. Burns gets into the how to change your way of thinking and how to you can change your behavior. He has tid bits on quitting smoking and a way to categorize and acknowledge your cognitive distortions, these that make life into a soup of negativity. He gets into a pillar of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which is the relationship between thoughts, emotions and behavior. How they reinfornce and feed off one another. My thought patterns seemed intractable, but over time (years) I have been able to change my thoughts. And yet I have much further to go. This was not the only book I've used to alter the deep crevices of old age in my mind like wrinkles under your eyes. Ah I'm aging. Old is good. Forty is young. Ninety is good to get to.</p>

  <p class="card-text">Milt Greek gave me some hope. He is a schizophrenia success story and outlined his method of finding love and a stable life.  He explains in a first person manner his experience with schizophrenia. He covers the strange anomalous experiences that can convince someone in psychosis to continue aberrant behavior. Just don't always trust your mind, because what you experience, even how true it seems, probably isn't actually what is happening. This framing simple is not a good way to view the world: a real versus not real perspective. Better to think how do I feel, ground myself. What do people around me think or do. It is not my job to determine the absolute truth. However Greek does outline some good ideas like train yourself on computers.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">The Road Less Traveled</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Mental Illness is a spiritual illness was the insight I took from this consortiom of printed pages. I listend to a sermon of the first Baptist Church Dallas and the preacher kind intimated that soul, spirit, mind are just loosey goosey words that relate to the same thing. (He made a joke, one gets a cough and they all get sick.) I also read a book written by a man from China on Qigong where he spells out the Chinese traditional view of the difference between spirit and qi or bioelectricity. He goes on toexplain what a soul is as well. But I don't always go so deeply into every book. I don't mean to denigrate the preacher because he's not a philosopher at an ivy leage school and crisp thinking is not what he's paid for. But having one's own definition of the spirit, the soul and the mind are good for anyone. These are different words and mean different things. I like the sermons anyways they give me hope and love is better than criticism. Also I like the exercises in the qigong book. Love is kind, love is patient, etc. And gratitude feels good!</p>

      <p class="card-text">People will henceforth in history be divided into two groups. Those who have read this book and those whom not have read. This is an important book. For me, this was very helpful in knowing what goes on in the brain after trauma. My amygdala is firing I know now if I'm feeling panicked. Talk to the hypothalamus and calm me down. This is not a fire this is something that triggers me. As far as therapies go, the book doesn't offer too much, maybe EMDR, but this hasn't helped so much for me; but I think this lack is just where the science is. First figure out what is wrong then how to fix it. Reading about trauma for me was quite difficult. So be careful. I had to put the book down for months. This may be difficult for you as well. But in knowledge there is hope. And knowing that my amygdala is on overdrive creating a constant fight or flight response in me elucidates much, so to speak. Even if I'm slow to realize I'm not a deer in the headlights. I'm simply me. Do re me dear.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Elyn Saks writes about her experience with schizophrenia. She is quite successful: a college professor at a prestigious law school. She writes of her attempts at psychoanalysis and finding a lover who writes notes in toothepaste on the bathroom mirror. How romantic! She says she wrote the book to counter portrails of people with schizophrenia as violent. She is certainly not violent and it appears self harm is more of a danger in people with schizophrenia. She tells of her childhood experiences. Of her University matriculation when symptom onset began. I think I watched a TED talk by her as well. I think she manages with medication.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Surviving Schizophrenia</h5>
      <p class="card-text">This book is a hard read because of the author's experience with his sister. Him being a doctor unable to help makes for a negative read, if you have the disease. Probably sympathetic if a family member has the disease. I think this read was rather negative towards the prognosis. But like taking a horse to water you can't heal someone else's mind. The sick one's mind has to take the initiative. This book is chock full of lists of entities working with schizophrenia and I think to remember that Torrey held a important position with an organization working within this field. I don't remember everything.</p>

      <p class="card-text">This book introduced a technique to get to the root of a thought. It helps some. What if this tbought is true. Then up the ladder to what if this thought is true. I think she also has a construct called the change triangle. I wanted to cut out some cardboard and walk through the city with my a large yellow change triangle being half super hero all mentally ill. But I didn't. And some things you don't regret. Like aberrant behavior. Common sense. Do other people do this? Does it help me accomplish my goals?</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents</h5>
    <p class="card-text">This book helped me a good bit. I had gotten to the point in my illness where I didn't really have a definition of emotion in my head. I might of had this as a child I can't remember. I really had regressed into not really having a theory of mind which is the technical term for realizing other people have them thoughts just like me. I know in high school I knew other people thought I was just too anxious to really process and accept and benefit from the thinking. But; over time, I just fell into a place where awareness of other people just wasn't really something I thought about. Boring life eh? What else is there but figuring out whether the woman will like this or not. I jest I jest. I'm still in no position to be in a relaitonship and I'm working on accepting this, but hope for improvement remains. Ah, this book describes how parents can sometimes emit the perspective that they are the only thing in the universe that matters. Their children hence have a difficult time thinking thoughts about themselves.</p>

As a sick human I feel that I'm far from being able to use this useful information, but if you read it now you'll process on it for so long while working on schizophrenia. I liked this book, and think it's helpful.</p>
