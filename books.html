  <h5 class="card-title">Feeling Good</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Feeling Good by David Burns was the first self help book someone gave me. I took the depression index test, and scoring highly, this indicated I had a severe depression. This fact for some reason discouraged me and I set the book down for about nine years. I eventually returned to the I have to help myself mentality and picking this book back up found the premise that changing one's thinking change lift one out of depression as hopeful. Burns gets into the change your way of thinking and you can change your life. He has tid bits on quitting smoking and a way to categorize your cognitive distortions that make life into a soup of negativity. He gets into a pillar of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which is the relationship between thoughts, emotions and behavior. How they reinfornce and feed off one another. My thought patterns seemed intractable, but over time (years) I have been able to change my thoughts. And yet I have much further to go.</p>

  <p class="card-text">Milt Greek gave me some hope. He is a schizophrenia success story and outlined his method of finding love and a stable life.  He explains in a first person manner his experience with schizophrenia. He covers the strange anomolous experiences that can convince someone in psychosis of abberant behavior. Just don't always trust your mind, because what you experience, even how true it seems, probably isn't actually what is happenning. This is just not a good way to view the world, a real versus not real perspective. Think how do I feel, ground myself. It is not my job to determine the absolute truth. However Greek does outline some good ideas like train yourself on computers.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">The Road Less Traveled</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Mental Illness is a spiritual illness was the insight I took from this consortiom of printed pages. I listend to a sermon of the first Baptist Church Dallas and the preacher kind intimated that soul, spirit, mind are just loosey goosey words that relate to the same thing. I also read a book written by a man from China on Qigong where he spells out the Chinese traditional view of the difference between spirit and qi or bioelectricity. I don't mean to denigrate because he's not the preacher is not a philosopher and crisp thinking is not what he's paid for. But having one's own definition of the spirit, the soul and the mind are good for anyone. Theses are different words and mean different things. I like the sermons anyways they give me hope and love is better than criticism also I like the exercises in the qigong book. Love is kind, love is patient, etc.</p>

      <p class="card-text">This is an important book. For me, this was very helpful in knowing what goes on in the brain after trauma. As far as therapies go, the book doesn't offer too much; but I think this is just where the science is. Reading about trauma for me was quite difficult. I had to put the book down for months. This may be difficult for you as well so be careful. But in knowledge there is hope. And knowing that my amygdala is on overdrive creating a constant fight or flight response in my elucidates much so to speak.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Elyn Saks writes about her experience with schizophrenia. She is quite successful: a college professor. She writes of her attempts at psychoanalysis and finding a lover who writes notes in toothepaste on the bathroom mirror. How romantic! She says she wrote the book to counter portrails of people with schizophrenia as violent. She is certainly not violent and it appears self harm is more of a danger in people with schizophrenia.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents</h5>
  <p class="card-text">This book helped me a good bit. I had gotten to the point in my illness where I didn't really have a definition of emotion in my head. I might of had this as a child I can't remember. I really had regressed into not really having a theory of mind which is the technical term for realizes other people have them thoughts just like me. I know in high school I knew other people thought. But I just fell into a place where awareness of other people just wasn't really something I thought about. Boring life eh? What else is there but figuring out whether the woman will like this or not. I jest I jest. I'm still in no position to be in a relaitonship and I'm working on accepting this, but hope for improvement remains. This book describes how parents can sometimes emit the perspective that they are the only thing in the universe that matters. Their children hence have a difficult time thinking thoughts about themselves.</p>
