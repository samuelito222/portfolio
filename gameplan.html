<p class="text-bg-secondary rounded">Yes life is about working. I've looed deeply into this because for a long time I didn't know: To live you have to work. Someone has to grow the peanuts and in our economy the peanut growers would get angry if we all sat by a body of water sipping free drinks while they toiled and making us peanut and delivering them. It's simple economics. Everybody must work. Even those with less capacity. Like me. So find something you can do and want to do. It's difficult, but work is fun.</p>
<p class="text-bg-info rounded">But my own apartment this is too hard. Yes things are very hard. But my goal is getting better and if you set a goal one might as well set it high. Or a least level with healthy people.</p>

<h6 class="badge text-bg-warning">Remember there is only so much to life.</h6><p class="text-bg-success">So what must be learned has a limit. We're not wondering about what trouble we'll have on the spacewalk when we get there. We're on earth and wondering how to cook indian food.</p>
