<h4>Freud! the Man, the Plan, the Brain!</h4>

<p>The brain is biological; yet, I think a bit of insight can be gleaned by using a computational
metaphor. In a microprocessor, on the most basic level, is a switch. On or off. By arranging
these switches into large combinations and applying correct programming one can
perform incredibly swift mathematics or also check a facebook page. The brain, likewise,
on a basic level has neurons and dendrites with a chemical electrical switch: the synapse.
My apologies for the simplification because I am no doctor only an amateur who learned
this by necessity and others have explained this elsewhere much better than I am able. This
is no new science brain science began in ? We are all given a brain. This is our life
processor. Ones mind is the data structure and the computer program. But I don’t know
javascript, what am I to do? Well in computer science, mimicking the brain learning
process, they developed a method to make a computer program learn. They called these
neural networks. If you are familiar with computer programming you might recognize the if
var &gt; 11 then do this else goto line 2749. I don’t know really but the brain’s program is not
this specific. People who have studied the brian have noticed that when a particular area of
the brain is damaged a certain behavioral function is lost. Like Broca’s area in the brain
which is hypothized to process language. A lot can be learned from the injuries related to
war. So it seems like there are functional regions of the brain which specialize. The general
technique is to process using a nueral network which is a bit like a pattern finder with a
reward stimuli. Descartes sought the seat of the soul in the pituitary gland and Chomsky
had his deep grammar of the mind. We will save these topics for Wikipedia as I’m not sure
how to respond to either. So my added amalgum of knowledge which I am attempting to
convey is we have a pattern finding processor with regional function specialization.</p>

<h4>Malady</h4>

<p>I think the mac was the first computer that you could type words into and then a voice
would play through the speakers. Anyways, my mind and any one with schizophrenia’s
mind needs a bit of… I believe the programming term is refactoring. The brain is a universal
computer. Really it could probably do anything. But for our purposes which for me is
towards healing I like to think that the goal is realigning the brain with general human
purposes. I fail at this. We are social animals and I am a solitude type. I don’t like this, I
enjoy interacting with others but I have fight or flight problems which don’t lead towards
extensive extemporaneous conversations. I don’t remove this from my goal set though. I
think the highest satisfaction in life I’ll find is developing relationships. Nothing is as
interesting as another person. I’ve heard of tree huggers, but I’m a person and enjoy trees
visually. But malady and the purpose of the brain… Being social, providing an economicfunction. Don’t quote me. This is what I’ve put together thus far. Nothing new here and it’s
always good to think for yourself and find your own purpose. I do, but I think other people
have good ideas too. So how to get out of malady and into functioning. How do you
reprogram a neural network. First check to make sure you have a crisis plan. Healthy
people don’t have mental crisis, people with schizophrenia do and to get into normal
function this threshold mush be crossed. This is quite serious so have a crisis plan. Crisis
can be dangerous.

<h4>Correction</h4>
My basic theory of correcting my brain came from a tidbit I read that people with
schizophrenia don’t really learn. So I’m learning a new language. One could learn to cook,
learn a musical instrument. Just some type of change. The brain changes as part of
learning. Here is a link to meta cognition of Wikipedia. The live expectancy of people with
schizophrenia is diminished because of the likelihood of self harm. This is dangerous
waters to tread in and need to be treated as such. Be sure to make your crisis plan and find
out how to calm yourself when in crisis and to avoid triggering events.
