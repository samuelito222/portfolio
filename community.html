      <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://www.goodwillcentraltexas.org/">Goodwill</a><p> After three attempts I got a job here. I worked here for two and a half years. They were always looking for new people to hire. They have plenty of work to do. I learned some important knowledge about business here.</p></li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://namicentraltx.org/">NAMI</a> <p> I had attended a NAMI group in another city after being recommended by a psychiatrist. Before the pandemic they had in person group therapy sessions twice a month. This was very helpful to be in a group of people struggling with similar issues.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://integralcare.org/en/home/">Integral Care</a><p> I used the local mental health services in a few cities. they have plenty of resources, but they are not going to get you a job and get you housing. It was just so hard to learn to be my own best advocate. And the reason why I didn't already know this was so hard to learn. Alas.</p></li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://koop.org/">Community Radio</a><p> I listen to several shows on this station which shares a signal with the local university radio station. Both offer a rather abundant selection of top notch programming. It's never the greatest hits all the time. It's always interesting.</p></li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://www.arcaustin.org/">The Arc of the Capital</a><p> I just found out about this place by listening to a radio show. I haven't used any services, but another resource is another resource, tautalogically speaking.</p></li>

      <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://www.twc.texas.gov/programs/vocational-rehabilitation">Texas Workforce Commission: Vocational Rehabilitation Services, formally DARS</a>
      <p> I used this service twice. With my counselors I learned that it is a job to get a job. I really went into this thinking that they would just place me somewhere. No. You have to work to show you can work. I did get enrolled in a Accounting/Bookkeeping course and learned Quickbooks. But the lack of self knowledge and not knowing what was good for me and what I desired to do. A correct fit if you will, hindered our progress.</p></li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi">Supplemental Security Income</a>
        <p> Wow. To have some steady money. This was a game changer to be able to have a monthly income of a few hundred. It's not enough to live on. At first I thought I should just live simply and use this for everything. But as I write elsewhere life is about work. And the more enjoyable work you can place yourself into the higher quality of life you can have. I had to learn this, I didn't know.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <a href="file.html">Therapists and Psychiatrists</a>
        <p> A therapy professional nor a psychiatrist is not going to cure you. I wanted more help than they could give. Alas, I did not know that i had to help myself. In hindsight, they were all pleasant to talk to. Schizophrenia is a rather tough nut to crack and they all did help. I am grateful of their time with me.</p></li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <a href="file.html">
          Local clubs for people with mental illness</a>
        <p> I attended a local art club for the disabled and they had some neat art supplies. This was good for me because my social skills were subpar for a put put golf course.</p></li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <a href="https://www.austincc.edu/">
          Community Colleges</a>
        <p> Community college is so cool. I really enjoyed my Accounting/Bookkeeping course. The instructor had industry experience and was on point. She knew her stuff and I enjoyed learning from her. The learning assistant gave me a hard time. I couldn't tell her to lay off, because I didn't want to talk about having schizophrenia, but if someone doesn't like you or gives you a hard time, it just sharpens you up and prepares you for better things.</p></li>
